In dotNet, we always use [`String.Format`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format.aspx) static method to replace the format items in a specified string with the string representations of corresponding objects in a specified array. Some of other methods also support the similar feature. We call this as [composite formatting](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txafckwd.aspx). It takes a list of objects and a composite format string as input.

A composite format string consists of fixed text intermixed with indexed placeholders, called format items, that correspond to the objects in the list. The syntax of format item is `index[,length][:formatString]` with outermost braces (`{` and `}`). The formatting operation yields a result string that consists of the original fixed text intermixed with the string representation of the objects in the list.

But how can we implement it?

## Usages

There are many overloads of `String.Format` static method. One of syntax is like following.

```csharp
public static string Format(
    IFormatProvider provider,
    string format,
    params object[] args
) { }
```

Following are the arguments.

- `provider`: An object that supplies culture-specific formatting information.
- `format`: A composite format string.
- `args`: An object array that contains zero or more objects to format.

It returns a copy of format in which the format items have been replaced by the string representation of the corresponding objects in args.

So we can use it like following.

```csharp
var name = "Kingcean";
var str = string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture, "Hi {0}, it is at {1:hh} o'clock now.", name, DateTime.Now);
```

The `str` variable will be following string if it is at 11:00 am now.

```
Hi Kingcean, it is at 11 o'clock now.
```

Lots of other methods which support composite formatting are based on the `String.Format` static method.

## String builder

In fact, dotNet implements `String.Format` static method by [`StringBuilder`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder.aspx) which is in `System.Text` namespace.

1. Acquire a `StringBuilder` instance.
2. Format strings and Append them to the `StringBuilder` instance.
3. Converts to string and release the `StringBuilder` instance.

The `StringBuilder` class is used to represents a mutable string of characters. It provides some member methods to append object to current string with higher performance than combining strings directly. Following are some examples of its member methods to append something.

```csharp
public StringBuilder Append(char value, int repeatCount = 1); 
public StringBuilder Append(string value);
```

It also support other overloads for further type as argument. And of course, it provide to append an object. The object will be convert to string if it is not null; otherwise, do nothing.

```csharp
public StringBuilder Append(object value);
```

This class also contain a member method for appending composite format string. Such as following.

```csharp
public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvider provider, string format, params object[] args);
```

We can call this method directly, too.

```csharp
var name = "Kingcean";
var sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.AppendFormat(CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture, "Hi {0}, it is at {1:hh} o'clock now.", name, DateTime.Now);
var str = sb.ToString();
```

The result is same as the above sample.

So we will introduce the implementation of this member method in C# here.

## Begin to implement

Firstly, we need validate the arguments. Both `format` and `args` are required.

```csharp
if (format == null)
    throw new ArgumentNullException("format");
 
if (args == null)
    throw new ArgumentNullException("args");
```

Then we need iterate all characters to append. To do so, we need record the item and index we are iterating, and get the length of the string to test.

```csharp
var pos = 0;
var len = format.Length;
var ch = '\x0';
```

And get the formatter which provides formatting service for the specified type.

```csharp
var cf = provider != null ? (ICustomFormatter)provider.GetFormat(typeof(ICustomFormatter)) : null;
```

Then we can iterate all characters and return current instance.

```csharp
while (pos < len)
{
    // ToDo: Append characters.

    pos++;
}
 
return this;
```

Now we need implement the while loop.

## Append normal characters

Because the string contains placeholder, we need find them and add normal ones firstly. We need update the To-Do in the above while loop as following. It needs another while loop before position increasing.

```csharp
while (pos < len)
{
    ch = format[pos];
    pos++;
    if (ch == '}')
    {
        // ToDo: For '}'.
    }
 
    if (ch == '{')
    {
        // ToDo: For '{'.
    }
 
    Append(ch);
}
```

It get current character and check if it is a brace (`{` or `}`). Append the character if it is not.

For left brace (`{`), we need break this while loop to get the format item.

```csharp
pos--;
break;
```

However, we need convert to normal character left brace (`{`) if it is 2 left braces ("\{\{"). So we need update it as following.

```csharp
if (pos < len && format[pos] == '{')
    pos++;
else
{
    pos--;
    break;
}
```

As same as right brace (`}`). We need convert to normal one for 2 right braces ("\{\{") and throw exception if there is only one.

```csharp
if (pos < len && format[pos] == '}')
    pos++;
else
    throw new FormatException();
```

So we have appended all normal characters to the `StringBuilder` instance and get the position of format items.

## Resolve argument

When the above while loop is break, it is in format items route. We need add logic after the position increasing in the outer while loop.

The syntax of format item is `index[,length][:formatString]` with outermost braces (`{` and `}`).

- `index`: The zero-based position in the parameter list of the object to be formatted. If the object specified by index is null, the format item is replaced by `String.Empty`. If there is no parameter in the index position, a `FormatException` is thrown.
- `length`: The minimum number of characters in the string representation of the parameter. If positive, the parameter is right-aligned; if negative, it is left-aligned.
- `formatString`: A standard or custom format string that is supported by the parameter.

So we need get index firstly. After the position increases (`pos++;`), we are in the position after the left brace (`{`). So that character should be a number.

```csharp
if (pos == len || (ch = format[pos]) < '0' || ch > '9')
    throw new FormatException();
```

Then need resolve the value of index by getting the character one by one for computing until it is not a number. The maximum value of index is 999,999.

```csharp
int index = 0;
do
{
    index = index * 10 + ch - '0';
    pos++;
    if (pos == len) throw new FormatException();
    ch = format[pos];
}
while (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9' && index < 1000000);
```

So we can resolve the argument which the index correspond to.

```csharp
var arg = args[index];
```

This will be formatted to append later.

## Get minimum length

Remove the white spaces after the index if has.

```csharp
if (index >= args.Length) throw new FormatException();
while (pos < len && (ch = format[pos]) == ' ') pos++;
```

Now, we need get its length. It may pad white spaces by left justify or right if the value is shorter than the minimum length so we need a flag indicating whether it is left justify. And then check if it is a comma. If so, a length is there. We need left trim it and begin to get the minimum length value.

```csharp
bool leftJustify = false;
int width = 0;
if (ch == ',')
{
    pos++;
    while (pos < len && format[pos] == ' ') pos++;
 
    if (pos == len) throw new FormatException();
    ch = format[pos];
    
    // ToDo: Get the length.
}
```

The length can be positive or negative for right or left justify. So we need check if there is a negative sign.

```csharp
if (ch == '-')
{
    leftJustify = true;
    pos++;
    if (pos == len) throw new FormatException();
    ch = format[pos];
}
```

Then the rest characters should be numbers. We can get the minimum length just like to get the index.

```csharp
if (ch < '0' || ch > '9')
    throw new FormatException();
do
{
    width = width * 10 + ch - '0';
    pos++;
    if (pos == len) throw new FormatException();
    ch = format[pos];
}
while (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9' && width < 1000000);
```

Well, let's go outside of the `if` scope of character equaling comma, we need right trim it.

```csharp
while (pos < len && (ch = format[pos]) == ' ') pos++;
```

Now we have gotten the minimum length of argument to present.

## Format argument

And try to get its `formatString` by the same way. It is after a colon. We need another `StringBuilder` instance for saving it.

```csharp
StringBuilder fmt = null;
if (ch == ':')
{
    pos++;
    while (true)
    {
        if (pos == len) throw new FormatException();
        ch = format[pos];
        pos++;
        if (ch == '{')
        {
            if (pos < len && format[pos] == '{')
                pos++;
            else
                throw new FormatException();
        }
        else if (ch == '}')
        {
            if (pos < len && format[pos] == '}')
                pos++;
            else
            {
                pos--;
                break;
            }
        }
 
        if (fmt == null)
        {
            fmt = new StringBuilder();
        }
        fmt.Append(ch);
    }
}
```

Validate if the end of the format item is a right brace (`}`). If so, continue to increase the position index.

```csharp
if (ch != '}') throw new FormatException();
pos++;
```

Then we need use the formatter to format the argument if has; otherwise, just convert it to string.

```csharp
string fmtStr = null;
string s = null;
if (cf != null)
{
    if (fmt != null)
    {
        fmtStr = fmt.ToString();
    }

    s = cf.Format(fmtStr, arg, provider);
}
 
if (s == null)
{
    var formattableArg = arg as IFormattable;
    if (formattableArg != null)
    {
        if (fmtStr == null && fmt != null)
        {
            fmtStr = fmt.ToString();
        }
 
        s = formattableArg.ToString(fmtStr, provider);
    }
    else if (arg != null)
    {
        s = arg.ToString();
    }
}
```

The `s` variable is the string formatted of the argument.

## Append the argument

If the argument string is null, we need use an empty string instead.

```csharp
if (s == null) s = string.Empty;
```

And get the length of padding to append.

```csharp
var pad = width - s.Length;
```

Then append the argument string and the white spaces if needed.

```csharp
if (!leftJustify && pad > 0) Append(' ', pad);
Append(s);
if (leftJustify && pad > 0) Append(' ', pad);
```

So that's all.
